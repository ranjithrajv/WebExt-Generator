# WebExt-Generator
A WebExtension which generates other WebExtensions, completely UI-based open source tool. Basic Knowledge on HTML, CSS & JS is good enough to create a WebExtension.

## Inspiration
This tool is a brainchild of the idea `WebExtensions should be able to generated within WebBrowsers`. Inspired from [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com/), this tool is designed to be used as boiler-plate code webextensions generator for Firefox Quantum and beyond.

## Vision
We are working towards enabling WebExtensions Development completely in WebBrowsers, with good user experience. Our goal is to make WebExtension Development more accessible.
